    <p>This is a web app that I created to help myself study Chinese (specifically 官话). I use it to supplement my
      learning on my phone using HelloChinese & Pleco. Unfortunately, neither of those apps have any sort of desktop
      client so I wanted the ability to test myself on a laptop or desktop computer.</p>
    <p>The main features I plan to add are:
    <ul>
      <li>Phrase and sentence-based quizzes. I already get lots of practice on the apps with individual character
        quizzes which I feel is insufficient.</li>
      <li>Create a flash card system with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
          repetition</a></li>
      <li>Track progress and performance over time</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Some stretch goals include <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest">integrating
        Google's APIs for text-to-speech</a> so you can hear both question and answer phrases.</p>
    <p>I have <i>little-to-no interest</i> in adding AI to this project. What I will likely use are LLM chat bots, such
      as ChatGPT & Gemini, to generate phrases to use as the test data. My goal is to be able to generate 1000's of
      phrases, store them in a database and ensure they are grammatically correct while allowing phrases to be more
      "dynamic" (for example, using different adjectives on specific subject/noun combinations). Because this is meant
      to be used for learning, I am prioritizing accuracy over variety (for now).</p>
    <p>This project is open source so you can find the code on <a
        href="https://github.com/coopernetes/practice-zh">GitHub</a>.</p>
