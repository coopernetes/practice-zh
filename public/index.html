      <p>This is a web app that I created to help myself study Chinese (specifically 官话). I use it to supplement my
        learning on my phone using HelloChinese & Pleco. Unfortunately, neither of those apps have any sort of desktop
        client so I wanted the ability to test myself on a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

      <button hx-get="/new" hx-target="#content-area" hx-swap="innerHTML">Try out practice-zh quizzes</button>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>The main features I plan to add are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phrase and sentence-based quizzes. I already get lots of practice on the apps with individual character
          quizzes which I feel is insufficient.</li>
        <li>Create a flash card system with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
            repetition</a></li>
        <li>Track progress and performance over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some stretch goals include <a
          href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest">integrating
          Google's APIs for text-to-speech</a> so you can hear both question and answer phrases.</p>
      <p>I have <i>little-to-no interest</i> in adding AI to this project. What I will likely use are LLM chat bots,
        such
        as ChatGPT & Gemini, to generate phrases to use as the test data. My goal is to be able to generate 1000's of
        phrases, store them in a database and ensure they are grammatically correct while allowing phrases to be more
        "dynamic" (for example, using different adjectives on specific subject/noun combinations). Because this is meant
        to be used for learning, I am prioritizing accuracy over variety (for now).</p>
      <p>This project is open source so you can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/coopernetes/practice-zh"
          target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I don't plan on hosting this anywhere except
        locally for the time being. You are free to self-host and play around if you wish.</p>
