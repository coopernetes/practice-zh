<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><i>Last Updated: January 11, 2026</i></p>

<p>
  I am not a lawyer but I have made every effort to protect your privacy. In
  this policy, "I" refers to the individual developer of this application.
</p>

<section>
  <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
  <p>
    I collect the minimum amount of data necessary to provide you with a
    functional learning experience:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Email Address:</strong> Used solely for authentication (sending
      your generated password) and to associate your custom word lists with your
      account.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>User-Submitted Word Lists:</strong> Any vocabulary lists you
      create or upload to test yourself are stored so you can access them across
      sessions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. How I Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Authentication:</strong> To log you in securely without requiring
      a traditional password setup. Passwords are generated and sent to your
      email. These passwords are hashed and salted before storage. These
      passwords expire after 30 days of inactivity. Logging in again after that
      date generates a new password which is sent to your email.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Personalization:</strong> To ensure that when you log in, your
      specific study materials are ready for you.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No Tracking:</strong> I do not use third-party trackers,
      advertising cookies, or analytics that identify you personally.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> I <strong>never</strong> sell,
      rent, or share your email address or personal word lists with third
      parties.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security:</strong> Your data is stored in a secure database with
      industry-standard protections. Passwords are hashed and salted to prevent
      unauthorized access.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Public vs. Private Data:</strong> While the app’s source code and
      general linguistic datasets are open-source (under CC-BY-SA or similar
      licenses), your
      <strong>personal word lists and email address are kept private</strong>
      and are not part of the open source code.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Open Source Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    The code powering this application is fully open source. You can audit how I
    handle data by visiting my repository at

<section>
  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You own your data. If you wish to have your account and all associated word
    lists deleted from my database, please see contact details below, and I will
    purge your information immediately.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If I change how I handle data, I will update this page. Since I don't use
    marketing emails, I recommend checking this policy periodically.
