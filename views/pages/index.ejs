  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    practice-zh is a web app I built to support my own Chinese learning,
    specifically Standard Mandarin (普通话). It’s designed to complement mobile
    apps like HelloChinese and Pleco, but with a focus on desktop-friendly
    practice and transparency in how study material is sourced.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wanted a simple way to practice reading, vocabulary, and sentence
    recognition on a laptop or desktop, using my own data and learning pace.
  </p>

  <p>
    All language content in the app is derived from open, publicly available
    resources, including official HSK vocabulary lists, CC-CEDICT, and
    public-domain example sentences. User study material is generated by
    selecting and combining subsets of this data into personal word banks,
    rather than introducing proprietary or closed datasets.

    The source code is available on

    random thoughts in a blog on the
