  <p>This is a web app that I created to help myself study Chinese (specifically 普通话). I use it to supplement my
    learning on my phone using HelloChinese & Pleco. Unfortunately, neither of those apps have any sort of desktop
    client so I wanted the ability to test myself on a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

  <p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/coopernetes/practice-zh" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If
    you're interested in following along as I build this app, I'm writing random thoughts in a blog on the <a
      href="https://coopernetes.github.io/practice-zh/blog" target="_blank">doc site</a>.</p>
