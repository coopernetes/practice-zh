# Intro

practice-zh (pronounced "practice zed-h" 🇨🇦) is a web app that I'm building to help myself study Chinese (specifically
Mandarin Chinese, 普通话). I will use it to supplement my learning of the language on apps like
[HelloChinese](https://www.hellochinese.cc/) & [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) which I use daily on my phone. Both of
these apps are amazing in my opinion. Unfortunately, neither of those apps (as is the case with many popular language
learning tools these days) have any sort of desktop client so I wanted the ability to test myself on a laptop or desktop
computer.

I also wanted a simple way to practice reading, vocabulary, and sentence recognition in a way that I have control over
the content I’m practicing against. This is important for
[comprehensible input](https://www.mandarinblueprint.com/blog/the-open-secret-of-immersion-learning-for-languages/).
Personally, I struggle to find the right resources for my level, so being able to upload my own content and practice
against it is a key feature for me.

## Pros and Cons of existing apps

Pleco in particular is one of my favourite pieces of software if for no other reason than their
[commitment to ongoing support of their users](https://www.pleco.com/products/) as well as their pricing model. You pay
for the app and content add-ons but there is no subscription fees. Anyone who is interacting with the Chinese language
at all should have this app. It is well worth the money, the company stands behind their product, and it is doesn't cost
you a monthly fee.

The same I cannot say for other apps in this category (including HelloChinese). Many of them are subscription based and
require you to pay monthly fees to access content. This is not sustainable for many users, especially those who are
learning multiple languages or who are on a budget.

## Can't you just use Anki or other existing apps?

Anki is a wonderful app. However, I find that flash cards are not a great study device for myself. I want something that
generates sentences & phrases so that I can increase my comprehension.

I also want the ability to tailor my learning for my ongoing progress as well as test myself on phrases that I'm
starting to pick up from my native Chinese colleagues & friends.

Other apps that I've tried I found to be either too expensive (DuChinese, The Chairman’s Bao, etc) or too limited in
terms of content (most apps that are free or cheap tend to have a limited library of content). They also tend to be
mobile only which is a limitation for me.

It's also an excuse for me to get serious about learning web development. I've been a backend and tools developer
(DevOps, cloud, etc) for a long time and I really want to build an intuitive interactive app. What better excuse than
something I'll want to use every day?

Not to mention, this is a good use case for LLMs & AI™.

## OK so what is the point of this site?

This site is primarily to document my development goals and maybe blog a bit about my journey learning Chinese by
developing this app. If I finish this project, this will serve as a user guide as well - hopefully, that won't be
necessary and it's intuitive enough to use without too much explanation. I really want to avoid a
[Pied Piper situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoRRJxI0rNY).
